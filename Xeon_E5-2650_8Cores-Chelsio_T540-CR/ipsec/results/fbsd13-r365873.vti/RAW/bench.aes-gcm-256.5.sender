CMD on 192.168.1.8: equilibrium -4 -d 00:07:43:2e:e4:70 -t vcxl0 -r vcxl1 -l 10000
Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 10000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 5000 Mb/s
  - Step = 2500 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1253 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 1253 Mb/s
  - Step = 626 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1213 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 627 Mb/s
  - Step = 626 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 626 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 940 Mb/s
  - Step = 313 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 939 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 1096 Mb/s
  - Step = 156 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1095 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 1174 Mb/s
  - Step = 78 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1173 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 1213 Mb/s
  - Step = 39 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1212 Mb/s
Iteration 8
  - Offering load = 1232 Mb/s
  - Step = 19 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 1231 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 1231 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 1253 Mb/s)
