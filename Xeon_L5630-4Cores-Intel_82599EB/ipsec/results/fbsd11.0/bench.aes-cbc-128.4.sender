CMD: equilibrium -4 -d 00:1b:21:d3:8f:3e -t igb2 -r igb3
Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 1000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 500 Mb/s
  - Step = 250 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 500 Mb/s
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 750 Mb/s
  - Step = 250 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 750 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 1000 Mb/s
  - Step = 250 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Warning: Generated only 958Mb/s in place of 1000Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 866 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 875 Mb/s
  - Step = 125 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 867 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 813 Mb/s
  - Step = 62 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 813 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 844 Mb/s
  - Step = 31 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 845 Mb/s
  - forwarding rate greater than offering load! (forcing FWRATE=OLOAD)
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 859 Mb/s
  - Step = 15 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 860 Mb/s
  - forwarding rate greater than offering load! (forcing FWRATE=OLOAD)
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 859 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 867 Mb/s)
