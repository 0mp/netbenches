Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Mode: IPSec gateway benchmark
- UDP load = 500B, IP packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 100 Mb/s
- TOLERANCE = 0.01
- Software netmap UDP checksum = on
Iteration 1
  - offering load = 50 Mb/s
  - STEP = 25 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 50 Mb/s
Iteration 2
  - offering load = 75 Mb/s
  - STEP = 25 Mb/s
  - TREND = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 73 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - offering load = 63 Mb/s
  - STEP = 12 Mb/s
  - TREND = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 63 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - offering load = 69 Mb/s
  - STEP = 6 Mb/s
  - TREND = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 68 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - offering load = 66 Mb/s
  - STEP = 3 Mb/s
  - TREND = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 65 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium link throughput= 65 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 73 Mb/s)
