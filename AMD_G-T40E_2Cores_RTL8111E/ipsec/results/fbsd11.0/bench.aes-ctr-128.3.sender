CMD: equilibrium -4 -d 00:0d:b9:3c:dd:3d -t igb2 -r igb3
Benchmark tool using equilibrium throughput method
- Benchmark mode: Bandwitdh (bps) for VPN gateway
- UDP load = 500B, IPv4 packet size=528B, Ethernet frame size=542B
- Link rate = 1000 Mb/s
- Tolerance = 0.01
Iteration 1
  - Offering load = 500 Mb/s
  - Step = 250 Mb/s
  - Measured forwarding rate = 97 Mb/s
  - Forwared rate too low, forcing OLOAD=FWRATE and STEP=FWRATE/2
Iteration 2
  - Offering load = 97 Mb/s
  - Step = 48 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 83 Mb/s
Iteration 3
  - Offering load = 49 Mb/s
  - Step = 48 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 49 Mb/s
Iteration 4
  - Offering load = 73 Mb/s
  - Step = 24 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 70 Mb/s
Iteration 5
  - Offering load = 61 Mb/s
  - Step = 12 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 61 Mb/s
Iteration 6
  - Offering load = 67 Mb/s
  - Step = 6 Mb/s
  - Trend = increasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 66 Mb/s
Iteration 7
  - Offering load = 64 Mb/s
  - Step = 3 Mb/s
  - Trend = decreasing
  - Measured forwarding rate = 63 Mb/s
Estimated Equilibrium Ethernet throughput= 63 Mb/s (maximum value seen: 97 Mb/s)
